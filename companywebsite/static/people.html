            <h2>Similarities Between Steve Jobs and Tim Cook </h2>
            <ul>
              <li><h4>Creating Buildup: </h4>Before revealing the new products, both Steve and Tim ensure that they remind people how great Apple products are, especially the iPhone. They walk the audience through a quick history of the iPhone and talk about the values of Apple.</li>
              <li><h4>Superlative Words: </h4>When Steve Jobs described Apple products, it seemed as if it is the best product available in the world and no Company can even match them. While launching iPhone 6, Tim Cook used a similar approach to tell the public just how 'WOW' the Smartphone is and that it beats any other Smartphone out there. Below is a comparison of the words that were used by Steve Jobs and Tim Cook during the launch of iPhone 4 and iPhone 6 respectively.</li>
